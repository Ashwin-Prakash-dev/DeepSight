# DeepSight status

**Last updated:** 2026-10-03 (`demo2` breast classification and batch slide ordering; device validation pending).
**Hackathon clock:** H0 = TBD. Fill in the start time so everyone can convert H-numbers to clock times.

Rules: AGENTS.md. Edit only your track's section, plus any rows you own. Say how each fact was verified, or mark it UNVERIFIED.

## Gates
| Gate | Due | Definition | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | H10 | Malaria field image → result on a physical Android phone | **partial:** a field photo gives a `field_result` plus provisional triage on the demo phone via the debug-only `DeepSight debug` screen (Track C below). Not yet in the main case flow (#30); accuracy not validated |
| G2 | H18 | 2 packs + router + quality gate + report | not started |

**Cut lines:**
- G1 missed by H12: everyone moves to malaria.
- G2 missed by H20: switch to a rule-based router and a template report.

## Spikes
| Spike | Question | Owner | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | NLM Malaria Screener: licence, can the model be extracted, does it convert to ONNX? | Codex | **partial:** thin TFLite conversion works; upstream reuse remains blocked, while a licensed dataset and evaluation-model fallback are pinned; first pack golden case still pending ([evidence](spikes/S1-malaria-screener.md)) |
| S2 | ONNX Runtime on Android | C | **yes:** CPU and XNNPACK outputs passed on the Nothing A059 within 1e-5; timings recorded below |
| S3 | LiteRT-LM Gemma inside our app | D | **yes:** Gemma 4 E2B streams in our own app on the edge 50 fusion (LiteRT-LM 0.17.1, GPU, GPU+MTP and CPU). With the malaria ONNX pack loaded too: 820–982 MiB PSS, 1.5 GiB still available. Warm GPU load 12 s, 50 tokens in 3.7 s with MTP. So the phone report can use Gemma; the template stays the fallback ([evidence](spikes/S3-litertlm-gemma.md)) |
| S4 | Phone → laptop hub over hotspot, cleartext HTTP | TBD | not started |
| S5 | DeFungi classes | Gemini | **dropped 2026-10-03** with the fungal pack (team decision). Was done: 5 classes (TSH, BASH, GMA, SHC, BBH), no normal class. Yes, leak-free split is possible via filename prefixes. |
| S6 | PathOS conversion | TBD | not started |

## Tracks

### A: ML packs (owner: TBD)
- **Done:** 
  - S1 repository/model inspection and thin TFLite conversion proof. The test-first setup/downloader creates the project Conda environment, verifies pinned checksums, excludes unverified candidates by default, and loads the approved MobileNetV2 state dictionary. Baseline CI runs downloader tests, contract validation and engine JVM tests without downloading weights; both jobs passed on PR #1 (run `36971884205`). No dataset or model weight is committed.
  - **B-ALL cascade (2026-10-03):** replaced the leukaemia stub with two pinned ONNX assets stored in `ml/packs/leukaemia_wbc/`: SatellaDet-Blood automatically detects/crops WBCs, then a converted MobileNetV2 classifies every crop as `early_pre_b_like`, `pre_b_like`, `pro_b_like`, or `benign`. There is no operator-confirmation gate. The contract remains frozen; `detector.json` is a pack-local auxiliary sidecar whose weights and checksum are verified by `PackLoader` and `check_packs.py`. The only deterministic contract triage is `NEEDS_EXPERT`; the app detects classification-only packs and hides triage/report presentation, including saved-case/history presentation. **Evidence:** contract validator pass; pack hashes pass; 77 Python tests pass after the final rebase; `:engine:testDebugUnitTest`, `:app:compileDebugKotlin`, and `:app:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin` pass. Source-TFLite versus converted-ONNX parity on 3 deterministic random tensors: maximum probability difference `4.887580871582031e-06`, identical top-1. `LeukaemiaModelsDeviceTest` passed on the rebased `leukamia` branch on a Motorola edge 50 fusion (Android 15/API 35, arm64-v8a): CPU and XNNPACK loaded and executed both packaged models, classifier zero-input probabilities matched within `2e-5`, detector output was finite with shape `[1,7,33600]`, test time `1.643 s` for both providers. `LeukaemiaFieldDeviceTest` then passed the complete detector-to-crop-to-classifier cascade on the same phone for CPU and XNNPACK using the fixed NIH-NLM/RBCNet blood field: quality passed, one crop was retained, both providers classified it `benign`, and pipeline totals were 1.623 s and 1.120 s. The provisional quality limits were adjusted to `min_blur=8.0` and `max_clipped_fraction=0.45`, values measured for these NIH-NLM fields, not leukemia images. The old differently signed app was explicitly uninstalled (erasing its local data), and `installDebug` succeeded. **UNVERIFIED:** leukemia-domain full-field performance, detector preprocessing/threshold calibration and recall, cascade/classifier accuracy, memory, patient-grouped metrics, artifact redistribution licences, and automatic-crop versus operator-crop degradation. The integration field is not leukemia ground truth. **Enabled in `DemoPacks` by team decision (2026-10-03)**, on the strength of `LeukaemiaModelsDeviceTest` and `LeukaemiaFieldDeviceTest` (also passed on a moto g32, Android 13, 2026-10-03); it still has no `PackGoldenTest` case (`golden/` holds the skeleton's dummy files), so it doesn't meet docs/architecture.md's golden-test rule. This is B-ALL cell classification, not a smear diagnosis, blast-percentage estimate, stage, severity, or prognosis.
  - **Fungal pack removed (2026-10-03, team decision):** `ml/packs/fungal/` (a placeholder model only, issue #13) and `scripts/make_fungal_dummy.py` are deleted, with the DeFungi rows in architecture.md, datasets.md and LICENSING.md. Older notes below that mention the fungal stub are history.
- **`ml/packs/malaria_thin/` (NLM thin-smear CNN as ONNX):**
  - **Done:** pack format. The manifest passes `validate.py`; triage, quality and uncertainty are PLACEHOLDER. Also added: the README, golden expected outputs, and the Python reference, moved to `ml/reference/malaria_pipeline.py`.
  - **Model:** switched to NLM's Sudan-retrained model for the demo (2026-10-02), the one NLM's app loads (`CameraActivity.java` line 277).
    - On the RBCNet negative patient it flags 5.6% of cells instead of 18.0%.
    - It misses more infected cells (sensitivity 86.3% vs 96.6% on NIH crops, kit's figures, not held out).
    - Replace it after measurement on annotated field photos.
    - `model.onnx` outputs logits: the final Softmax is removed by `ml/tools/onnx_logits.py`, because the engine's decoder applies softmax. Expected outputs stay probabilities.
  - **Verified:** `MalariaPackGoldenTest` passed 3/3 on the edge 50 fusion demo phone with this model, loaded from `malaria_thin/` (`:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest`, 2026-10-02):
    - Test A, CPU and XNNPACK: within 6.3e-7.
    - PNG chips with a Kotlin `INTER_CUBIC` port: within 5e-5. Android bilinear: 0.064 off (0.149 with the previous model).
  - **In git (private repo only):** `model.onnx`, so the team can test; its licence is unresolved (S1), so it must not leave the private repo. CI's pack-hash check (`ml/tools/check_packs.py`) now checks it. The NIH golden chips stay out of git until the cell_images licence is resolved.
  - **Quality thresholds:** PROVISIONAL `min_blur` 8.0 and `max_clipped_fraction` 0.45, from 8 RBCNet fields (`QualityGate` blur 12.8–15.8; 33–37% black pixels from the vignette). The placeholders (100 / 0.05) rejected every NLM photo.
  - **Field golden:** `golden/field_synthetic.json` holds the Python pipeline's cells and scores on `ml/tests/data/nlm_synthetic.png`, bound to the model by `model_sha256`.
  - **Segmentation:**
    - **Port:** `ml/reference/nlm_segmentation.py` is a faithful Python port of NLM's `MarkerBasedWatershed` and `Cells.runCells`. It is GPL-3.0 ([LICENSING.md](../LICENSING.md)), selected with `--seg nlm`; the old version is `--seg simple`.
    - **Verified bit-exact** against NLM's original Java on OpenCV 3.4.2 (a desktop harness, not in the repo): 0 differing mask pixels and identical cell lists on 8 RBCNet fields.
    - **Per-cell check on the six annotated reserved fields** (`ml/eval/eval_annotated_fields.py`, `nlm`, Python reference, 2026-10-02):
      - **Segmentation:** cell counts within 5% of the annotation; 39 of 40 infected cells inside a detected box.
      - **Sudan model:** flags 28 of 40 infected cells, with 18 false flags among 861 uninfected cells. 14 of them are on one slide (C38P3). The previous model flags 35 of 40, with 64 false flags.
      - **Not accuracy:** 3 reserved patients, and NLM's training overlap is UNVERIFIED. On the edge 50 fusion, the app's `CaseRunner` gives the same counts: parasitized identical on all six fields, cells within 1 (`AnnotatedFieldsDeviceTest`). Table in the [pack README](../ml/packs/malaria_thin/README.md#known-limits).
    - **The earlier RBCNet comparison** (C12N negative vs C92P53 positive, `nlm` 5.6% vs 3.6% flagged) had patient-level labels only, so it mostly measured false flags. It is not evidence that the pipeline can't separate them.
    - **Kotlin port:** done (`RbcDetector.kt`, see Track C).
- **Next:** independently evaluate the fallback model on the licensed NIH-NLM data, export the chosen model to ONNX, and create the first golden case in `ml/packs/malaria_thin/`. Replace every UNVERIFIED and PLACEHOLDER manifest value before enabling the pack.
- **Breast pack `ml/packs/breast_breakhis/` (branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/a-breast-pack`, 2026-10-03):** a demo-only classifier. Every case requires clinician review; model predictions do not produce an abnormal or normal screen status. `DemoPacks` lists it as ready.
  - **Done:** `reference/pipeline.py` (the app's resize, quality gate and `field_result`), `reference/eval_breakhis.py`, `prepare_pack.py` (logits model, manifest hash, golden JSONs), `model_logits.onnx` (sha256 in the manifest), and 6 golden cases. 17 breast tests in `ml/tests` pass, and `validate.py` and `check_packs.py` pass.
  - **Verified before `demo2` (edge 50 fusion, 2026-10-03):** `PackGoldenTest` passed all 6 breast cases within 0.02. `BreastCaseDeviceTest` recorded the model's false positives on benign-labelled fields. Its prior `ABNORMAL_FLAG` triage behavior is superseded by the classification-only manifest in `demo2`. The merged changes pass JVM tests and install on a phone; the contract validator and manual breast/batch result walkthrough remain pending.
  - **Finding:** Pillow's anti-aliased resize and the app's resize differ by up to 0.07 in p_malignant on the 6 images, so the earlier goldens would have failed the phone test, so the 90.5% accuracy figure (Pillow) does not hold for the app. Re-measured on all 1,693 BreakHis 400x images with the app's preprocessing: accuracy 89.3%, sensitivity 93.6%, specificity 80.3%, AUC 0.958; not held-out. Details in the pack README.
  - **Not done:** held-out accuracy, a validated triage threshold, a router, a phone-photo domain check. BreakHis redistribution terms are UNVERIFIED (LICENSING.md).

### B: Android shell (owner: TBD)
- **`demo2` result presentation (2026-10-03):** whole-field classifiers show the predicted class and model score without confusing `1`/`0` count tiles. Batch case results rank slides by the pack manifest's deterministic per-field outcome: flagged, needs review, then no flag. `TriageEvaluator.evaluateField` applies manifest rule conditions to each slide's counts and image score. Breast results are classification-only and do not report `ABNORMAL_FLAG`. **Verified on the Motorola edge 50 fusion (Android 15):** `:engine:testDebugUnitTest`, `:app:testDebugUnitTest`, and `:app:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin` passed; `installDebug` installed and launched `MainActivity`. **Pending:** contract validator and manual breast/batch result walkthrough. The Conda command was unavailable in this shell.
- **Done:** package `com.deepsight`, modules `:app`, `:engine` and `:report`. The stock Compose screen runs on a physical Android phone.
- **Skeleton (issue #26):** choose test → case → result → review/sign-off → history with a fake engine (`FakeEngine`, reads `contracts/examples`); disclaimer on every screen. **Verified on a phone (moto g32, Android 13, 2026-10-02):** `installDebug` installed and `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` passed 2/2, including `NavigationTest` (all screens + disclaimer).
- **Done (#27):** gallery import (photo picker, bytes copied unchanged) and CameraX capture (CameraX 1.6.2) save into `filesDir/cases/<caseId>/field_<n>.<ext>`; the files are the fields. **Verified on a moto g32 (Android 13) (2026-10-02):** `installDebug`; an imported PNG was byte-identical to the source, a captured JPEG was written, and both listed as fields on the case screen, with the rest of the skeleton flow still working; `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` 2/2, `CaseStoreTest` and `:engine:testDebugUnitTest` pass. Image files survive an app restart; history does not yet (in-memory until #28). It sits on the case screen above the fake engine's field list (the case id comes from the fake engine until #30); Room is not used yet.
- **Case storage (#28, issue closed 2026-10-02: the moto g32 run meets the AGENTS.md device rule):** Room 2.8.5 + KSP 2.3.12 in `:app` (`data/CaseDb.kt`, saving in `App.kt`): sign-off saves the case, its fields and the case_result JSON; saved cases are loaded into the history list at startup. Versions from dl.google.com maven-metadata and Maven Central, 2026-10-02. **Verified on a moto g32 (Android 13) (2026-10-02):** `installDebug`, `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`, and a signed-off case still listed in History after force-stop and relaunch (driven with adb).
- **Result screen + sign-off (#29):** `result/ResultScreen.kt` replaces the skeleton's result and review screens. Per field: quality pass, or reject reasons with Recapture (goes back to the case screen); router message; counts. Case: triage level, rule id, **provisional** badge, uncertainty, report slot ("Report pending (#24)" until the template report lands). Sign-off: clinician name + accept/override (override needs a note), saved into the case row's sign-off columns (`SignOff.applyTo`), which never touches `case_result_json`; the saved sign-off shows again when the result is reopened. The bbox overlay is skipped (no field images in the fake-engine case). **Verified on a moto g32 (Android 13) (2026-10-02):** `:app:testDebugUnitTest` (`SignOffTest`), `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` (`NavigationTest` now covers badge, Recapture, name entry, sign-off), and by hand with adb: sign off, force-stop, relaunch, reopen the result: it showed `ACCEPT by DrTest`. The screening-aid line is the disclaimer bar already on every screen.
- **UI polish (branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/b-ui-polish`, 2026-10-02):** small changes, mostly in new files, so #30 can still restructure `App.kt`.
  - **Theme:** a fixed teal DeepSight scheme replaces the template purple. Wallpaper-based dynamic colour is off (`DeepSightTheme(dynamicColor = false)`) so triage colours and contrast are the same on every phone.
  - **`ui/components/TriageBadge`:** the result screen shows the exact level string on a red, amber or green surface (`LocalTriageColors`), with a plain-language meaning from `triageStyle()`. Wording is generic across packs and never diagnoses.
  - **`ui/components/DeepSightTopBar`:** a back button whenever there is a previous screen, next to the existing system-back handler. The icon is a vector drawable, so there's no new dependency.
  - **Previews:** `@ThemePreviews` (light and dark) for the badge, the top bar and `ResultScreen`.
  - **Verified on the edge 50 fusion (2026-10-02):** `installDebug`, then all 8 `:app` device tests pass via `am instrument` (`NavigationTest`, new `TopBarNavigationTest` and `TriageBadgeTest`, `RouterResultScreenTest`, `CaseDaoTest`, example). JVM tests pass, including the new `TriageStyleTest` (4). A walkthrough by hand with screenshots was not done, because the phone was in use.
- **Real engine (#30), verified on a moto g32 (Android 13) and the Nothing A059 (Android 16), 2026-10-02:** `FakeEngine` is gone. The picker lists `PackLoader.discover()` packs (rejected ones are logged under `DeepSight`); each case gets a fresh `case-<millis>` id; "Show result" runs every stored image through `CaseRunner` off the main thread (full-resolution decode + EXIF rotation, `FieldPipeline` with `CellFinders.forPack`, then `closeCase`). The last pack's pipeline is kept, so its model loads once; switching packs frees it, and a pack whose model fails to load can't break the next one. Failures and out-of-memory show on the case screen; a run the user backed out of never opens its result; Recapture deletes the rejected image. Field ids are `<caseId>_field_<n>` (Room keys fields by `field_id` alone). **Evidence:** `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` 10 pass + 4 `GemmaOnDeviceTest` skipped (no `.litertlm` on the phone): `CaseRunnerTest` 4/4, `NavigationTest`, `ResultScreenTest`, `RouterResultScreenTest` (now reads the contract examples from the test APK), `CaseDaoTest`. `installDebug` walkthrough driven with adb: picker shows Fungal, Leukaemia and Malaria; two NIH RBCNet field photos (5312x2988, imported byte-identical) gave quality pass, router match and `ABNORMAL_FLAG`/`parasite_seen` (provisional): negative patient `239C12NThinF/IMG_20150614_124212` 226 cells, 15 parasitized (Python reference `ml/data/rbcnet_eval/per_image.csv`, Sudan model + NLM segmentation: 225 cells, 14 flagged); positive patient `234C92P53ThinF/IMG_20150821_150718` 215 cells, 6 parasitized (reference 217, 6). `timing_ms` total 7.3 s and 5.0 s per field (cells 4.0/2.4 s, quality 1.6/1.2 s). Accept and override sign-offs, both cases in History, and their Room rows (signer, decision, note, image path, unchanged triage) survived force-stop + relaunch. A malaria photo in the fungal pack was rejected (blur, underexposed) → `NEEDS_EXPERT`/`engine.insufficient_fields`, Recapture deleted it; malaria then ran again in the same session with the same result. **Nothing A059:** the installed APK pulled back off the phone carries `malaria_thin/model.onnx` with sha256 `4ae01239…`, identical to the repo and the manifest, and no `FakeEngine` class; the positive-patient field gave the same 215 cells / 6 parasitized in about 7 s. **Not checked:** the stub-model ORT failure in the app UI (covered on device by `CaseRunnerTest` with a broken pack), release-build memory (no `largeHeap`), the edge 50 fusion demo phone. **The wiring matches the Python reference; the triage does not separate these patients:** the model flags ~3-7% of cells on both, and `parasite_seen` fires at 1 parasitized cell (Track A/E).
- **Demo app on branch `eval` (2026-10-02, kept off `test` on purpose):** the full flow (photo → real pack → triage → Gemma report → sign-off → history), with the UI redesigned along the guidance in `claude-android-skill` (MIT, kept outside the repo).
  - **Architecture:** `AppViewModel` holds the back stack and the UI state (`CaseUiState`, `ResultUiState`, `ReportUiState`) as `StateFlow`, collected with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`. Screens are stateless (`home/`, `capture/CaseScreen`, `result/`, `history/`, `about/`), so state survives rotation. No Hilt or Navigation library: `CaseRunner` and `ReportService` are process singletons. `App.kt` is now a thin router; the case logic from #30 moved into the ViewModel with the same behaviour.
  - **Design system:**
    - `ui/theme`: teal scheme, type scale, shapes, triage colours.
    - `ui/DeepSightIcons`: material-icons-core plus six Material icon drawables.
    - `ui/components`: disclaimer bar, pills, stat tiles, empty state, and `FieldImage`, which draws the model's cell boxes on the photo.
    - Light/dark previews.
  - **Screens:**
    - **Home:** on-device and AI-report status, and the packs. Packs not yet validated on a phone are shown but can't be opened (`DemoPacks`).
    - **Case:** step indicator, import/capture, thumbnail grid, per-field progress.
    - **Result:** triage badge, stats, streaming report, field photos with flagged cells, and a sign-off that waits for the report.
    - **History:** a read-only detail that shows the report the clinician saw.
    - **About:** GPL notices, licence text, NLM credit.
  - **Data:** Room v2 adds `report_text` and `report_source` to `cases` (`CaseDb.MIGRATION_1_2`).
  - **Offline:** the manifest removes the INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions declared by onnxruntime-android 1.30.0 and media3-common. The APK requests only CAMERA (`aapt2 dump permissions`).
  - **New libraries (shared catalog):** lifecycle-runtime-compose and lifecycle-viewmodel-compose 2.6.1 (the project's lifecycle version), and material-icons-core (BOM, 1.7.8).
  - **Verified on the edge 50 fusion (2026-10-02):**
    - **Device tests:** after `installDebug`, all 22 `:app` device tests pass via `am instrument` (every one except the S3 benchmarks):
      - `NavigationTest`, updated to open the first validated pack and press "Analyse";
      - `TopBarNavigationTest`;
      - new `HomeAndAboutTest`: unvalidated packs stay on Home, no network permission, and the About notices, licence and NLM notice open;
      - new `ReportCardTest`;
      - `ResultScreenTest`, `RouterResultScreenTest`, `TriageBadgeTest`;
      - new `CaseDbMigrationTest`, on a real v1 database;
      - `CaseRunnerTest`, `CaseDaoTest`, `AnnotatedFieldsDeviceTest`;
      - new `PipelineReportDeviceTest`.
    - **JVM tests:** 110 pass (engine, report, app).
    - **By hand on the phone:** an imported field gave quality pass, 28 parasitized and 388 uninfected, `ABNORMAL_FLAG`, the cell overlay and a Gemma report, analysed in 8.7 s.
  - **Known gaps:**
    - Process death loses a case in progress (no `SavedStateHandle`).
    - Release-build memory is unchecked (no `largeHeap`).
    - Compose's `LocalLifecycleOwner` shows a deprecation warning until Lifecycle is 2.8 or later.
    - Not run on another phone model.
- **Patients and the FCFS case queue (#64, branch `Abhay-Mmmm/b-patient-records-and-a-sequential-fcfs-case-que`, 2026-10-03):**
  - **Base:** includes Ashwin's `b-profiles-ui` (the patient Profiles screen; it isn't on `test` on its own) and the bottom nav from `test` (#67, which also brought `b-analysis-timestamp`). It replaces #63/PR #66's UI. The case flow runs in the Single tab's back stack. The Profile tab (the phone's users, in memory) is separate from patients (Room); see `AppViewModel.profiles` vs `patients`.
  - **Room v4 (`MIGRATION_3_4`):**
    - A `patients` table: UID `P-XXXX-XXXX` (Crockford base32, `SecureRandom`, retried on a clash), name, ISO date of birth and sex. These are the fields the Profiles screen shows; blood group was dropped.
    - Cases gain `patient_uid` (foreign key, no cascade), `status` (old rows become `SIGNED`) and `error`.
    - `Patient` validates itself and is the only validator.
  - **Flow:** choose test → choose patient or add one → case.
    - **Analyse:** submits the batch to `CaseQueue`, which runs one batch at a time, first in first out, and survives leaving the screen. Restart recovery re-runs `QUEUED`/`RUNNING` rows. A failed batch is marked `FAILED` and the queue moves on.
    - **History:** a finished, unsigned case opens for sign-off.
    - **Sign-off:** an UPDATE (`CaseDao.sign`), not a REPLACE.
    - **Profiles:** the screen reads Room.
  - **Backup:** the database and `files/cases/` are excluded from cloud backup and device transfer.
  - **Tests:**
    - JVM, written first and passing: `PatientTest` (8), `ProfilesOfTest` (2).
    - New device tests, written first: `CaseDbMigrationTest` (v3 → v4), `PatientDaoTest`, `CaseQueueTest` (fake runner: order, failure, restart, recapture, sign-off), `QueueParityDeviceTest` (real malaria pack; needs a field photo pushed as `queue_parity.jpg`).
    - Updated for the patient step: `NavigationTest` and `ProfilesScreenTest`. `ProfilesNavigationTest` seeds Room instead of using `SampleProfiles`. `NavigationTest` and `TopBarNavigationTest` now scroll to History, which the Profiles card pushed below the fold.
    - **Verified on the edge 50 fusion (Android 15, 2026-10-03):** after `installDebug installDebugAndroidTest`, the full `:app` device suite passed through `am instrument`: OK (46 tests). These are skipped because their files aren't on the phone: Annotated, Breast, Gemma, PipelineReport.
    - The phone had another machine's debug signature, so the app was uninstalled first. Its data was a v2 database with no cases plus 2 photos, backed up locally first.
  - **Walkthrough on the edge 50 fusion (2026-10-03), driven with adb; Room checked after each step:**
    - **Migration:** the phone's own v2 database opened as v4.
    - **New patients:** 2 created, getting `P-V9JH-XPR4` and `P-WXZY-KRCW`.
    - **Back out:** backing out during a 4-field run, that run finished `DONE` in the background.
    - **Queue:** patient 2's batch, submitted during patient 1's 8-field run, showed "Queued behind 1 batch".
    - **Force-stop:** the app was force-stopped with batch 1 `RUNNING` and batch 2 `QUEUED`. After relaunch, both finished in submit order with the right `patient_uid`. Another force-stop mid-run also recovered (4/4 fields).
    - **Sign-off from History:** "Ready for sign-off" opened the result without Recapture. The case became `SIGNED`, keeping its `patient_uid`, field and `analysed_at`.
  - **Measured on the edge 50 fusion:**
    - **Disk:** about 2.6 MB per imported NIH field (5312x2988 JPEG, stored unchanged) and about 1 MB per camera capture. Room adds about 29 KB per field; the database was 1.4 MB for 10 cases and 28 fields (`du`, sqlite).
    - **Camera:** a capture during a running 8-field batch succeeded. Preview smoothness was not measured.
  - **UNVERIFIED (moto g32):** the same MB-per-patient figure, and whether CameraX stays usable during inference on a low-end phone.
  - **Batch tab shows the queue; the patient list is now "Patients" (2026-10-03):**
    - **Batch tab:** its "Batches" section lists every unsigned case in submit order: running (field i/n), queued (place in line), ready for sign-off (tapping opens it in Single, without Recapture) or failed (with the error). Bulk image selection is now enabled (next bullet).
    - **Rename:** the patient list's title and the Home card say "Patients"; the Profile tab (the phone's users) keeps "Profiles".
    - **Tests:** `BatchesTest` (JVM, 3, written first; passes). `BatchScreenTest` and the renamed `ProfilesNavigationTest` compile; **not yet run on a phone** (the phone is off).
- **Patient profile: search and retrieval (#65, branch `Abhay-Mmmm/b-patient-profile-search-and-retrieval`, 2026-10-03):**
  - **Search:**
    - A patient ID typed without its dashes or `P-` now matches (`v9jhxpr4` finds `P-V9JH-XPR4`), only once the query is at least 4 characters long.
    - Search stays in memory (`searchProfiles`), because the list already loads every patient. There is no SQL `PatientDao.search` and no 50-row limit, a deliberate deviation from the issue.
  - **Profile:**
    - Tapping a patient opens `Route.Patient`: name, ID, age, sex and date of birth, then their tests newest first.
    - The screen reads `CaseDao.casesFor(uid)` (a Room Flow), so a batch moving from queued to done shows without a refresh.
    - FAILED rows show their error, and unsigned rows show when they were submitted (also in History).
    - A row opens like one in History.
    - The row mapping is the pure `historyItemsOf`, tested by `HistoryItemsTest` (JVM, 3, written first): triage level, null before triage or on bad JSON, the error carried through.
  - **Fix:** `openSaved` read the case status from `history`, which is only kept while History or Home is on screen, so a test opened from elsewhere did nothing. It now reads Room.
  - **Tests:**
    - JVM, written first: `ProfileSearchTest` (UID without dashes; short queries don't match IDs).
    - Device:
      - `CaseDaoTest`: newest first, and a re-emit on QUEUED → DONE.
      - `CaseQueueTest`: sign-off leaves `case_result_json` byte-identical.
      - `ProfilesNavigationTest`: patient → their FAILED test with its error.
  - **Verified on the edge 50 fusion (2026-10-03):**
    - After the date change: `ProfilesNavigationTest`, `NavigationTest` and `TopBarNavigationTest` pass (4) through `am instrument`. A screenshot showed Walk One's rows with their submit times.
    - `installDebug installDebugAndroidTest`, then the full `:app` device suite through `am instrument`: 53 of 54 pass.
    - The one failure is `BottomNavTest.tabsSwitchAndKeepTheirOwnStack`, which fails the same way on unmodified `origin/test` `d2d6cb8`, so it predates this work.
  - **Walkthrough (adb-driven, on the #64 walkthrough patients):**
    - search `v9jhxpr4` and `walk one`;
    - open Walk One's newest DONE test, with photos and cell boxes and the template report (no Gemma on the phone);
    - sign off;
    - force-stop and relaunch: the profile shows the signed test.
    - In Room afterwards: `SIGNED`, same `patient_uid`, 8 fields, and `case_result_json` byte-identical to its value before sign-off.
  - **Not walked by hand:** creating a patient and watching a new batch run live. No photo was imported, but `CaseDaoTest` covers the Flow re-emit.
- **Bottom navigation (branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/b-bottom-nav`, 2026-10-03):** three tabs, each with its own back stack (`NavState` in `Navigation.kt`). **Batch** was UI only at the time (superseded by the batch upload bullet below). **Single** is the existing flow unchanged (choose test → case → result → sign-off → history) and is where the app starts and where back ends. **Profile** lets you add and pick profiles (`profile/Profiles.kt`), in memory only: nothing saves them and nothing else reads them yet. It also links to About. An analysis still running when you switch tabs puts its result on Single without switching to it. Reselecting Single, or backing out, cancels it as before. The disclaimer bar sits just above the tab bar on every screen.
  - **Verified:** `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passes (36 tests, including the new `NavStateTest` 8 and `ProfilesTest` 5). `:app:compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin` passes.
  - **Phone verification added 2026-10-03:** `BottomNavTest` (3), `NavigationTest`, `TopBarNavigationTest` and `HomeAndAboutTest` passed on the Nothing A059 as part of the 56-test app run below.
- **Result readability + Single/Batch separation (2026-10-03):** result counts use readable labels in a two-column grid, show the patient, warn when a passed classification-only field returns zero cells, and keep field images collapsed until requested; the persistent disclaimer is unchanged. Room v5 records `submission_source`; Single still uses the shared FCFS runner but its cases no longer appear in Batch, and v4 rows migrate to `SINGLE`. **Verified on the Nothing A059 (Android 16):** user walkthrough looked good; app JVM tests and lint passed; focused device tests passed 14/14; full app instrumentation returned `OK (56 tests)`, with local-asset tests skipped because their files were absent.
- **Batch upload with module allocation (ported from `demo`, `7104901` + `34d9a6f`, 2026-10-03):** on the Batch tab, "Select images" picks many images; a **PLACEHOLDER** router (`RandomFieldRouter`, random, until #22 trains one) suggests a module per image. The allocation screen lets the user move any image to another module ("Changed by you") and needs a patient. Submitting needs a person to tick "verified"; any change clears the tick. Submit makes one case per module and hands them to `CaseQueue`. Before analysis only, Batch tab only: Single still picks the test first, and the engine `RouterGuard` stays a verifier.
  - **Fix:** `BatchSubmitter` passed no source, so `CaseQueue.submit` defaulted to `SINGLE` and batch cases never showed in the Batch list (`batchSubmissions()` lists only `BATCH`, since `b07a050`). `enqueue` now takes a `SubmissionSource` and is called with `BATCH`; callers pass `queue::submit`.
  - **Tests:** `BatchSubmitterTest` (JVM) asserts `BATCH`. `BatchEndToEndDeviceTest` asserts that `batchSubmissions()` lists every submitted case; on the pre-fix build it failed on the moto g32 (`expected:<[case-…-1, case-…-2]> but was:<[]>`), and it passes after the fix.
  - **Verified on the moto g32 (Android 13, 2026-10-03):** `installDebug installDebugAndroidTest`, then through `am instrument`: `BatchEndToEndDeviceTest` passed (malaria → `ABNORMAL_FLAG`/`parasite_seen`, breast → `NEEDS_EXPERT`/`review_only` after `a84a4e2`, from the `DeepSightBatch` log, not a skip); `BatchAllocateScreenTest` + `BatchScreenTest` OK (9); full `:app` suite OK (64 tests: 59 pass, 5 skipped because Gemma isn't on the phone). `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passes (82). **Walkthrough by hand:** 3 images picked; the router misplaced two; both moved ("Changed by you"); ticking enabled Analyse, a later move cleared the tick and disabled it; re-verified and submitted; the Batch list showed both cases (Breast, Malaria) "Ready for sign-off".
- **Batch upload through the router (branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/d-router-onnx`, 2026-10-03; in `fd` only its router is kept, see the `fd` entry below):** the Batch tab's "Coming soon" placeholder is replaced.
  - **Flow:** "Select images" (multi-select photo picker) copies the images unchanged. `CaseRunner.route` runs each through the shipped router (`ml/router`, on its own router copy, so sorting doesn't wait for a running batch). The tab shows the proposal: one group per installed test with thumbnails and the router's confidence, plus skipped groups for "not recognised as a slide" and for tests this build doesn't have (fungal). An optional patient applies to all of them.
  - **Submit or discard:** Submit queues one `SubmissionSource.BATCH` case per test on the existing FCFS queue, and they appear in the Batches list. Nothing runs before Submit; Discard deletes the copies. Each field is still checked by its pack's router guard.
  - **Code:** `batch/BatchUpload.kt` (`planOf`, `BatchUpload`), `BatchScreen.kt`, `AppViewModel` upload state, `CaseRunner.route`, `CaseStore.delete`.
  - **Verified:** JVM `BatchUploadTest` 4/4 (written first), app JVM 69/69. On the edge 50 fusion via `am instrument`: `BatchScreenTest` 5/5 (picker enabled with no "Coming soon", sorting progress, review groups, submit/discard) and `CaseRunnerTest` 7/7 (the shipped router sorts a noise image as reject).
  - **Not verified:** a by-hand run through the photo picker. A demo set is in the phone's "DeepSight batch demo" album: 2 RBCNet fields, 2 BreakHis goldens, 1 noise image.
- **Next:** save the phone-user profiles and use the active one for sign-off. `eval` was merged into `test` (`e89b1b6`). The G1 gate row (not Track B's) can now point at the main case flow.

- **Delete history entries (branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/b-delete-history`, 2026-10-03, not pushed):** on History, press and hold a case to select it, tap to select more, then **Delete** after a confirmation (it says how many are signed off). Deleting removes the case row and its fields (Room cascade) and the case's image folder (`CaseStore.delete`, which ignores an id that points outside the store).
  - **Cases the queue still owns can't be deleted.** QUEUED and RUNNING ones can't be selected, and `CaseDao.deleteFinished` skips them too, because the queue writes its result into the stored case when it finishes. Done, failed and signed cases can go.
  - **Verified on the edge 50 fusion (2026-10-03):** `HistoryDeleteScreenTest` (7), `CaseDeleteTest` (2) and `DeleteHistoryFlowTest` (two cases seeded in the app's own database, one deleted through the real UI: row, fields and images gone, the other untouched). JVM: `HistorySelectionTest` (4), `CaseStoreDeleteTest` (3); 164 pass.
  - **Known flaky test, not from this change:** `BottomNavTest.tabsSwitchAndKeepTheirOwnStack` fails intermittently on plain `test` too (5 of 16 runs on `ac8f03c`, 1 of 8 with this change); the failures are `Choose test` present or absent at the wrong moment, so it looks like a race with the screen transition or pack loading.
  - **Not done:** deleting from a patient's test list, and any undo or export before deleting. Signed-off records are deleted for good.
- **Branch `fd` (2026-10-03, not pushed): `test` `9b8e36a` + `demo` + `demo2`.**
  - **From `demo`:** the launcher fix (only `MainActivity` is a launcher entry in debug builds) and History multi-select delete. The batch allocation was already on `test` (`0a6629e`).
  - **From `demo2`:** the trained ResNet18 router (`ml/router`, engine `router/`), also used as each case's router guard in `CaseRunner`; the Profile tab showing patient profiles (the phone-user profile screen is gone); result-screen and breast changes; History's per-row trash delete.
  - **Duplicates resolved:** batch uses `test`'s allocation screen (move, verify, patient) with the trained router in place of `RandomFieldRouter` (`fieldRouterOf`; reject or a test the app lacks, such as fungal, leaves the image unallocated; if the router fails, nothing is suggested). Sorting shows "Sorting image i of n…". `demo2`'s propose-then-submit review UI (`BatchUpload`, `UploadUiState`) and its tests (`BatchUploadTest`, two `BatchScreenTest` cases) are removed. History offers both deletes: trash icon for one record, press and hold for several; `CaseStore.delete` keeps the path check.
  - **Left out of `demo2`:** `folder/` (the router drop; `ml/router` holds the files used), `android/hs_err_pid4260.log`, `ght.venvScriptsactivate.bat`.
  - **Verified:** JVM 195 pass (engine, report, app), including new `TrainedFieldRouterTest` (4, failed first) and `demo2`'s router tests.
  - **On the edge 50 fusion (2026-10-03):** `installDebug` as an update (Gemma model and data kept). `RouterModelDeviceTest` 3/3 (`:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest`, class filter). Full `:app` suite via `am instrument` (Gemma benchmarks excluded): 76 of 77; the failure was `demo2`'s `ProfilesNavigationTest.profilesLiveOnTheProfileTabAndAreSearchable` (6 of 6 runs): after typing in the search box, Back only closed the keyboard. With `closeSoftKeyboard()` before Back it passed 4 of 4.
  - **Walkthrough (adb-driven):** Batch tab → photo picker → the "DeepSight batch demo" album (2 NIH-NLM malaria fields, 2 BreakHis slides, 1 noise image). The router sorted them in under 2 s: both malaria fields to Malaria, both breast slides to Breast, the noise image Not allocated ("Router did not recognise this image"), and Verify blocked until it was placed. After removing it, choosing a patient and verifying: two BATCH cases. Malaria: 21 parasitized / 420 uninfected, `ABNORMAL_FLAG`/`parasite_seen`. Breast: 2 malignant, `NEEDS_EXPERT`/`review_only`. Every field's router verdict was `match` (0.992–1.000), router step 61–342 ms (Room rows read after the run).
### C: On-device engine (owner: TBD)
- **Done:**
  - Contract types and JSON in `engine/.../contract/`. 4/4 JVM tests pass, and the JSON they write passes `validate.py`.
  - S2:
    - `engine/.../onnx/OnnxModel.kt` runs on CPU or XNNPACK (onnxruntime-android 1.30.0).
    - `OnnxSmokeTest` uses `ml/eval/make_smoke_model.py`: a 64×64 cell-crop-sized CNN with random weights. CPU and XNNPACK outputs matched the desktop golden output within 1e-5 on the Nothing A059 via `:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest` (2/2 tests passed).
    - Median inference: CPU 0.6 ms at batch 1 and 72.1 ms at batch 256; XNNPACK 0.7 ms and 68.3 ms. See Verified facts for the measurement method.
  - **Done (#15, PackLoader framework):** discovers on-phone ONNX packs in APK assets, rejects invalid manifests/files and SHA-256 mismatches, and exposes only verified packs for the picker. Its 8 JVM tests pass; a synthetic smoke pack loaded through `AssetManager` and created an `OnnxModel` on the Nothing A059 (`:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest`, 3/3 tests passed).
  - **Done (#16, preprocessing framework):** pure Kotlin converts `PixelImage` to float32 tensors with stretch/letterbox/center-crop/none resize, RGB/BGR, NCHW/NHWC and manifest scale/mean/std; unsupported dtype/stain modes fail explicitly. Eight synthetic JVM tests pass; manifest preprocessing into the smoke ONNX model matched its desktop output within 1e-4 on the Nothing A059 (`:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest`, 4/4 tests passed).
  - **Done (#17, cell-crop framework only):** pure Kotlin validates pixel boxes, normalizes them to the frozen bbox contract and extracts ordered crops without changing pixels. Four synthetic JVM tests pass. OpenCV is deferred until #10 specifies the reference algorithm.
  - **Done (#18, classifier decoders):** manifest-driven softmax/sigmoid decoding produces objects, per-label counts, max image score and score-band uncertainty; quality rejection clears downstream values. Nine JVM tests pass, and decoder-generated `field_result` JSON passes `contracts/validate.py`.
  - **Done (#19, aggregation and triage):** `engine/.../triage/TriageEvaluator.kt` implements `contracts/README.md` steps 1-6 in pure Kotlin: `evaluate(caseId, fields, manifest)` returns a `CaseResult`. 22 JVM tests cover each step and its order, all five ops, a missing label, a null image score and a hand-computed multi-field case; engine JVM suite 62/62. Its `case_result` JSON passes `contracts/validate.py` (run from a scratch venv with `jsonschema`, since Conda isn't installed on this machine). JVM only: not run on a phone, and the inputs are hand-built fixtures, so behaviour on real model output is UNVERIFIED until #20 wires the pipeline. Counts, score and uncertainty are aggregated even when an early step decides, so the result always shows what was seen.
  - **Done (#20, field pipeline):** `engine/.../pipeline/FieldPipeline.kt`: `analyzeField(caseId, fieldId, bitmap)` runs quality → router stub (always `match` until #23) → crops → preprocess → one batched `OnnxModel.run` → `ClassifierDecoder`, filling `timing_ms` (quality, router, preprocess, pack, total); a quality reject stops early with only quality and total. `closeCase` delegates to `TriageEvaluator`, so #19 now also ran on real model output. `source: cells` packs take an injected `CellFinder`; no real one exists yet (#10 is Python-only), so only a test double has run, and without one they fail with a clear error. **Verified on a moto g32 (Android 13) (2026-10-02):** `:engine:testDebugUnitTest` passes (`FieldPipelineTest`: reject path; its JSON passes `validate.py`), and `:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest` passes, including `FieldPipelineDeviceTest`: the smoke pack through real ORT, score matching the desktop output, then `closeCase`. One measured field: `quality=11 router=0 preprocess=57 pack=7 total=78` ms (64×64 smoke image, XNNPACK is the default; this test used CPU). The smoke model is random weights and its manifest applies softmax to outputs that are already probabilities, so this proves plumbing, not accuracy. The smoke field scored `positive` 0, so `closeCase` took the `engine.no_rule_matched` → `NEEDS_EXPERT` path; the abnormal-flag path on real output is UNVERIFIED. The accepted-path `field_result` JSON was not run through `validate.py`. **Also on the moto g32 (2026-10-02), 10 more instrumented tests, 15 in total passing:** `FieldPipelineCellsDeviceTest` (cells path with a test `CellFinder`: 3 crops batched in one run, each crop's bbox and score identical to running it alone, empty finder result, missing finder error, and a quality reject through a real `Bitmap` that never reaches the finder) and `TriageEvaluatorDeviceTest` (#19 on real pipeline output: count/score aggregation across 2 fields, max/mean/none, first-match-wins, no-rule-matched, insufficient fields, a quality-rejected field excluded, router mismatch/reject overrides, and the decoder's uncertainty flag turning a normal rule into needs-expert). The smoke model never predicted `positive`, so rules were built from observed counts rather than a real clinical threshold. Not yet run on any other phone model, including the edge 50 fusion.
  - **Done (#21, golden harness):** `PackGoldenTest` (androidTest) runs every `ml/packs/<id>/golden/<name>.png` through `FieldPipeline` and compares with `<name>.json` (a contract `field_result`) via pure-Kotlin `GoldenComparator` within `golden/tolerance.json` (default scores ±0.02, boxes ±2 px, counts exact); one pass/fail row per case, logged under `DeepSightGolden`. 7 comparator JVM tests pass. On a moto g32 (Android 13, 2026-10-02) `:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest`: `smoke/case1` PASS (expected values derived from the desktop PyTorch output by `ml/eval/make_smoke_golden.py`; a tampered expected score failed as intended); `fungal` and `leukaemia_wbc` FAIL by design (stub 18-byte models, placeholder non-`field_result` expected files, no `CellFinder`). **#21's "all #12 cases pass" box is still open:** #11/#12 have not delivered real malaria goldens. Convention for Track A: PNG inputs (not JPEG), `.json` = full `field_result`, `tolerance.json` optional.
- **Next:**
  - **Known #15 integration gap:** Track A has not delivered the final `malaria_thin` manifest/model. Stage them under the APK's `packs/` assets and repeat the device test with the real pack before G1; real-pack loading is currently UNVERIFIED.
  - **Known #16 parity gap:** compare tensors against #11's Python-reference dumps within 1e-4 when they land; Python/Android parity is currently UNVERIFIED.
  - **Known #17 segmentation gap:** port #10's exact RBC detector when it lands, add the OpenCV Android dependency then measure its APK delta, compare golden counts/boxes, and measure field runtime on a physical Android phone. RBC detection and parity are currently UNVERIFIED.
  - **Known #18 integration gap:** compare decoded objects, scores and uncertainty against #11's real reference outputs when they land; real-model parity is currently UNVERIFIED.
  - **Known #21 gap (issue closed, follow-up tracked here):** add the real `malaria_thin` goldens from #12 to `PackGoldenTest`, run `:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest` and record every case passing; replace the `fungal` and `leukaemia_wbc` stubs when Track A ships real models. Until then no real pack is golden-tested on a phone.
- **Update, malaria field pipeline (branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/c-malaria-field-pipeline`, 2026-10-02):** closes the #15 staging gap, #17, and the real-model part of #18. **Merged into `FieldPipeline` (#54); needs Abhay's review.**
  - **Code:**
    - `engine/.../segmentation/RbcDetector.kt` (+ `NlmHistogram.kt`) is the Kotlin port of `ml/reference/nlm_segmentation.py`, on OpenCV Android 4.14.0. It is GPL-3.0 (LICENSING.md).
    - **`CellFinder` now returns crops (`CellCrop`), not boxes,** so a detector can mask and resize them. A box-only finder returns `CellCropper.crop(field, boxes)`.
    - `pipeline/CellFinders.kt`:
      - `CellFinders.forPack(manifest)` gives the engine's finder: `RbcCellFinder` for `cell_type: rbc`, null otherwise.
      - `RbcCellFinder` cuts NLM-style crops (background black, bicubic to the model input). An NLM retake gives no cells, so triage says NEEDS_EXPERT.
    - `FieldPipeline` times the new step as `cells`.
    - `PackGoldenTest` passes `CellFinders.forPack`.
    - The app's case flow (#30) should call `FieldPipeline(pack, cellFinder = CellFinders.forPack(pack.manifest))`.
    - `:app` stages `ml/packs/*` (only folders that have a `manifest.json`) into the APK's `packs/` assets.
    - Debug-only `DebugAnalyzeActivity` ("DeepSight debug" icon) runs `FieldPipeline` on a picked photo (Android decoder + EXIF rotation): cell boxes, counts, `closeCase` triage, timings.
  - **Softmax:** `malaria_thin`'s `model.onnx` now outputs logits (final Softmax removed by `ml/tools/onnx_logits.py`). `ClassifierDecoder` applies softmax, the convention `make_smoke_golden.py` also encodes, so no engine change was needed. softmax(logits) matches the old probabilities within 3e-8.
  - **Verified on the edge 50 fusion** (`:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest`, 26 tests; the only failures are 4 by-design `PackGoldenTest` rows, see below):
    - **Same resized input:** the port matches NLM's Java golden (`RbcDetectorTest`).
    - **Full photo → cells:** within ARM/x86 OpenCV resize noise (±1 on ~1% of pixels); synthetic 123 vs 124 cells.
    - **8 RBCNet fields through `FieldPipeline` against desktop Python** (`RbcFieldPipelineTest`):
      - cell counts within 1.1%;
      - 92.6–97.7% of cells match (boxes within 2 segmentation px, scores within 0.02);
      - parasitized counts equal on the 4 positive-patient fields, +1 or +2 on the negative ones.
    - **Abhay's tests:** `FieldPipelineCellsDeviceTest` passes after its test double wraps `CellCropper.crop` and the timing keys include `cells`.
    - **The app itself:** `installDebug`, then the debug screen on an RBCNet field: 215 cells, 6 parasitized, same as Python, 3.2 s.
  - **Measured:**
    - Field time 2.4–3.4 s on the phone: quality ~0.45–0.7 s, cells 1.3–2.1 s, model 0.4–0.6 s.
    - OpenCV adds `libopencv_java4.so` 23.5 MiB + `libc++_shared.so` 1.2 MiB, stored uncompressed. Debug APK 74.1 MiB.
  - **For the team:**
    - **Quality gate (Track D):** `QualityGate` counts the black eyepiece vignette as underexposure (33–37% of every NLM photo) and measures blur over the whole frame.
    - **Golden harness (Abhay):** `PackGoldenTest`'s comparator wants exact counts, but ARM/x86 resize noise moves about 1% of `malaria_thin`'s cells, so a malaria case in the harness format needs a count tolerance in `tolerance.json` or a noise-free fixture.
    - **`PackGoldenTest` (#21):** 4 rows fail by design: `fungal` and `leukaemia_wbc` (stubs), `malaria_thin` (no case in the harness format yet), and a local untracked `breast_breakhis` folder. The other 22 engine device tests pass.
    - **Image decoding (Track B):** the case flow should apply the photo's EXIF orientation when decoding, as the debug screen and cv2.imread do; NLM photos are EXIF-rotated.
  - Aggregation and triage per `contracts/README.md`, as pure Kotlin with JVM tests.

### D: Gates and report (owner: TBD)
- **Done:** Pure-Kotlin quality-gate core accepts an Android-free ARGB pixel buffer, computes Laplacian variance and dark/bright clipped-pixel fractions, and applies each pack's `quality` thresholds. JVM tests cover sharp, blurred, overexposed, dual-clipped, boundary and sparse-field/per-pack cases (`:engine:testDebugUnitTest`).
- **Router guard framework (#23, partial):** `RouterGuard` is injected into `FieldPipeline`; `ScoreRouterGuard` deterministically maps #22's ordered labels and probabilities to `match`, `mismatch` + `predicted`, or `reject`. Mismatch/reject fields skip cell finding and pack inference, produce contract-valid `field_result` JSON, and drive `engine.router_mismatch`/`engine.router_reject`; the result screen shows explicit messages. Verified 2026-10-02 on the Nothing A059: before the final rebase the full app instrumentation suite passed 5/5; after rebasing onto the merged malaria pipeline, focused engine tests passed 2/2, focused mismatch/reject Compose tests passed 2/2, `installDebug` succeeded and the app cold-launched. JVM suites pass 82/82 engine and 8/8 app tests; both generated blocked-field JSON files pass `contracts/validate.py`.
- **Router classifier (#22), scaffolding only:** `ml/train/router_split.py` (split-manifest loader: every class needs 2+ sources and a named held-out source; labels derived from the manifest, reject last), `ml/eval/router_eval.py` (accuracy per held-out source, overall and confusion) and `ml/train/train_router.py` (MobileNetV2 backbone, softmax output, ONNX export, `labels.json`, `eval.json`). `ml/tests` pass 17/17 in a throwaway uv venv with `ml/requirements.txt` (not the Conda env; Conda is not installed on that laptop); the torch/ONNX test skips without torch, and the `ml-torch` CI job runs it with the pinned packages. CI also validates every `ml/packs/*/manifest.json` and checks each pack's model file against its manifest sha256 (`ml/tools/check_packs.py`). **Not done:** no model trained and no accuracy number, because the split manifest (#8) does not exist yet; golden match/mismatch/reject cases and the #31 entry are pending that training run. ImageNet backbone weights licence UNVERIFIED (check torchvision's weights terms before shipping).
- **Next:**
  - **Later integration:** match #11's Python reference scores within a stated tolerance once its exact scoring convention and golden outputs land; add the Bitmap/shared image adapter after the joint library decision with #17.
  - **Router trained and wired into the app (#22/#23, branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/d-router-onnx`, 2026-10-03):** the always-match stub is replaced for the four packs. The ResNet18 router from `folder/deepsight_router_colab.ipynb` now ships as `ml/router/`; details, sources and metrics are in [ml/router/README.md](../ml/router/README.md).
    - **How it works:** `RouterModel` (engine) checks the model's sha256 and labels, and `guardFor(packId)` gives `ScoreRouterGuard`. A pack it doesn't know (e.g. smoke) keeps the always-match stub. `RouterInput` and `PilBilinear` reproduce the notebook's preprocessing; `PilBilinear` is a port of Pillow's bilinear resize. `CaseRunner` loads it once per process, and the debug analyse screen shows the verdict.
    - **Measured by the notebook:**
      - 98.8% on unseen patients from the training sources.
      - 59.6% on whole sources it never saw: Kather tissue → breast 40/50, C-NMC crops → reject.
      - So real phone-camera photos are UNVERIFIED, and a wrong mismatch/reject now forces NEEDS_EXPERT.
    - **Verified:**
      - JVM: `PilBilinearTest` matches Pillow pixel for pixel, and `RouterInputTest` matches the notebook's tensors exactly; `RouterModelTest` also passes. `:engine:testDebugUnitTest` 99/99, `:app:testDebugUnitTest` 39/39.
      - On the edge 50 fusion: `RouterModelDeviceTest` 3/3. The 7 golden cases match PyTorch within 5e-10 on CPU and XNNPACK, and an RBCNet field matches on malaria_thin and is blocked on breast_breakhis. Router step 371 ms warm, 831 ms on the first field.
      - Full `:engine:connectedDebugAndroidTest`: 35/37. The 2 failures are the `PackGoldenTest` "no golden case" rows for leukaemia_wbc and malaria_thin.
      - `CaseRunnerTest` 6/6 via `am instrument`, including the shipped router rejecting a noise "field" on malaria_thin.
      - On the desktop, all 23 NIH-NLM demo fields in the repo route to malaria_thin.
    - **Not done:** the full `:app` device suite (the phone disconnected midway; `BottomNavTest` failed with no Compose hierarchy before that, which happens with a locked screen), a by-hand walkthrough, and fixing the notebook's BACH filter.
  - ~~A template report.~~ Done on branch `eval` (below).
- **S3, Gemma on LiteRT-LM (branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/s3-litertlm-gemma`, 2026-10-02):** details in [docs/spikes/S3-litertlm-gemma.md](spikes/S3-litertlm-gemma.md).
  - **Code:**
    - `report/.../gemma/GemmaRunner.kt`: loads a `.litertlm` from app storage (GPU or CPU, optional MTP) and streams text. It knows nothing about triage.
    - Debug-only `DebugGemmaActivity` ("DeepSight Gemma" icon): backend and MTP chips, an optional malaria ONNX pack, streaming output and timings.
    - `GemmaOnDeviceTest` (`:app` androidTest): GPU, GPU+MTP, CPU, and memory with the ONNX pack.
  - **Verified on the edge 50 fusion** (`am instrument` and the debug screen; not on the Nothing A059): all 4 Gemma tests pass and text streams on screen. Timings and meminfo are in the spike file.
  - **For the team:**
    - **Don't run `:app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` with the model on the phone.** It uninstalls the app, which deletes the 2.6 GB model. Use `am instrument` (spike file, How to reproduce).
    - **Kotlin:** LiteRT-LM 0.17.1 is a Kotlin 2.4 binary. `:report` skips the metadata check, and the app's runtime kotlin-stdlib is now 2.4.0. Upgrading the project to Kotlin 2.4 is the proper fix (team decision).
    - **The report (#24) should:**
      - load Gemma at app start on GPU with MTP, with the app's `cacheDir`;
      - keep the exact-triage-string check and the template fallback (`docs/architecture.md`).
      Gemma's output mostly restated the facts, so the prompt needs work.

- **Report (branch `eval`, 2026-10-02):** a template and Gemma narration, wired into the app.
  - **`:report` `CaseReport.kt`:**
    - `templateReport`: deterministic; the fallback.
    - `gemmaPrompt`: facts only and the exact level; Gemma never sees the other level names.
    - `checkNarrative`: the exact level and no other (docs/architecture.md, Report).
    - `cleanNarrative`, and `triageMeaning`, which the triage badge shares.
    - `CaseReportTest`: 7 JVM tests.
  - **`GemmaRunner.generate`** has a time limit and cancellation (`Conversation.cancelProcess`; throws `GemmaStopped`).
  - **App `ai/ReportService.kt`:**
    - `GemmaNarrator` loads Gemma at app start on GPU with MTP, S3's fastest setup.
    - `ReportWriter` waits up to 45 s for it, then streams, cleans and checks the text. Anything that fails, or no model, gives the template with the reason.
    - `ReportWriterTest`: 7 JVM tests.
  - **Measured on the edge 50 fusion** (`PipelineReportDeviceTest`, 3 runs):
    - **Timings:** `CaseRunner` took 2.2–2.9 s per field. Gemma loaded in the background in 11.8–14.6 s, then streamed the report in 5.2–6.2 s. Every run passed the check (source GEMMA).
    - **Output:** the same text in all 3 runs: "The malaria thin smear test was performed. 1 of 1 fields passed the image-quality check. Model counts across the passed fields showed 9 parasitized and 101 uninfected. The triage level is ABNORMAL_FLAG, which means a screening rule flagged this case and a clinician should review it."
    - **Sampling:** whether LiteRT-LM's default sampling is greedy is UNVERIFIED.

### E: Data, eval, clinical thresholds (owner: TBD)
- **Done:** Created `docs/datasets.md` mapping datasets, links, licenses, attributions, and grouping keys for ML packs (issue #5).
- **Done (#6, field assets):** independently read the NIH-NLM ThinBloodSmearsPf licence DOCX and README; retained its notice and attribution in `ml/fixtures/`. `malaria_fields.json` pins 3 golden fields (15/0/9 annotated parasitized RBCs), 3 separate demo fields and 2 reproducible synthetic failures, with image/annotation URLs and SHA-256 digests. `ml/tools/prepare_malaria_fields.py` fetches everything under ignored `ml/data/`; a fresh fetch and a network-disabled repeat verified identical generated hashes. The reserved patient keys `C70P31`, `C7N`, `C38P3` are rejected by the router split loader and reusable split validator, including their other fields/crops. Python suite 53/53 passed in the project Conda environment, including the trainer/export regression; existing CI discovers the new tests. JVM `ReservedMalariaFieldsTest` verified all six originals pass the unchanged quality gate, and both failure variants reject; engine suite 74/74. Counts, commands and exact rejection reasons are in [datasets.md](datasets.md#reserved-malaria-fields-6). These are infected-cell counts, not individual parasite counts. Physical-phone use of these selected images and model-output goldens remain separate G1 integration work; upstream pretrained-model patient overlap is UNVERIFIED.
- **Done (#7, sourcing):** reviewed WHO MM-SOP-08/09 and NLM's configurable capture target; [malaria threshold evidence](../ml/packs/malaria_thin/README.md#threshold-evidence-issue-7) records the thick-film negative examination minimum and why thin-film counting does not validate this pack's normal-screen rule. `triage.source` individually labels unsupported settings PROVISIONAL. In the `deepsight` Conda environment, the contract validator passed all pack manifests, the pack-integrity check passed, and `:engine:testDebugUnitTest` passed; semantic comparison against the rebased parent commit confirmed only `triage.source` changed. App presentation checked by source inspection only; no new phone-run claim.
- **Done (#31, claims registry):** [docs/claims.md](claims.md) separates 8 deck-safe measured engineering claims from unverified clinical, router, report and integration claims. Each measured number names its scope, method and source commit; missing model/router metrics remain UNVERIFIED with the issue that must measure them.
- **Next (#7, acceptance):** external deck compliance is UNVERIFIED (no deck in this checkout); Track F must audit it before the presentation checkbox can be completed. The automated thin-smear negative-call minimum and uncertainty calibration remain UNVERIFIED; obtain clinical review and held-out validation before changing values.

### F: Pitch and demo (owner: TBD)
- **Done (#32, draft):** generated an 8-slide Figma Slides pitch constrained to the deck-safe wording and claim IDs in [docs/claims.md](claims.md).
- **Next (#32, audit):** select one generated deck, record its URL, and audit every slide against `docs/claims.md`; no deck is approved until that inspection passes.

## Open risks
- **Malaria reuse licence:** the upstream root licence is BSD-like, at least 85 source files say GPLv3, and model provenance/licensing is not stated. See `docs/spikes/S1-malaria-screener.md`; do not vendor upstream artefacts until resolved.
- **Memory:** measured on the edge 50 fusion (S3): Gemma and the malaria ONNX pack fit (982 MiB PSS, ~1.5 GiB left), but loading Gemma makes Android kill background apps. Not measured on the Nothing A059 (same 7.3 GiB RAM) or on any smaller phone. Close other apps before a demo.
- **Kotlin 2.4:** LiteRT-LM 0.17.1 needs `-Xskip-metadata-version-check` in `:report`, and the app's runtime kotlin-stdlib is now 2.4.0 while the compiler is 2.2.10. Upgrading the project to Kotlin 2.4 is the proper fix (team decision; shared `libs.versions.toml`).
- **Hotspot routing (UNVERIFIED):** the phone may route traffic over mobile data when the hotspot has no internet. Test S4 with mobile data off.
- **Malaria model:** upstream extraction and thin-model conversion are feasible, but reuse licensing and active-model parity remain unresolved. A separately licensed dataset and evaluation model are available, but neither clinical quality nor Android parity has been established.

## Decisions
- 2026-10-02: Native Kotlin + Compose, Android only.
- 2026-10-02: Contracts v1.0 frozen. Triage lives on `case_result`, not `field_result`, because it runs after aggregation.
- 2026-10-02: ONNX Runtime and the Python tooling pinned to 1.30.0. Golden outputs depend on this.
- 2026-10-02: APKs are arm64-v8a only.
- 2026-10-02: `test` is the default branch, and all work lands there. `main` only gets commits verified on a physical Android phone, promoted by fast-forward (AGENTS.md, Git).
- 2026-10-02: The repo is private, so the team's model weights and sample data are committed (`ml/models/*.onnx`, `ml/data/`, the malaria pack's `model.onnx` and golden chips) so everyone can test. Their licences are UNVERIFIED; take them out of git before the repo goes public ([LICENSING.md](../LICENSING.md), AGENTS.md exception). The `breast_breakhis` model and its 6 golden images are committed too, on the same terms (branch `Ashwin-Prakash-dev/a-breast-pack`).
